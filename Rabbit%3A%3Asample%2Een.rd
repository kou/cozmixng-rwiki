= What's this?

A presentation tool

  * written by Ruby
  * used GTK+ 2
    * because I want to do
      * OK?

= Features

  * source is RD
  * align with RWiki
    * edit source on the RWiki
    * when presentation, source is directory from RWiki
  * isolate RD and look and feel

= Available(('sup:up')) things(('sub:down'))

  * do (('del:not')) ((*emphasis*))
  * sub(('sub:script')) and super(('sup:script'))
  * mathematical characters (('&Sigma;'))(('&sum;sub:i=0'))
  * display image

= More available things

  * auto reload modified source
  * reload theme
  * auto generation of index page
  * right click menu

= More more ...

  * screenshot on the off screen
  * Internationalized message
  * PS/PDF output ((-but quality is ...-))

= More more more ...

  * Table
  * colorize source
  * funny themes
  * graffiti on the slide

= More(('sup:4')) ...

  * organize screenshots
  * mouse gesture

= Not available

  * inline image
  * jump to the link

= ToDo

  * handle sound
  * handle 3D (I wish there were a library of X3D)
    * now OpenGL is supported

= Call on

  * cool themes
  * great documents

= Save slides

  * can save slides as image
  * can save simple HTML for viewing images
  * but ...
    * organizing screenshots beautifully is the work of other tools
    * ((<RAA:gallery>)), zphoto and so on

= What about image?

  * OK, if it is not inline

    resizable

      # image
      # src = lavie.png
      # caption = Lavie
      # keep_ratio = true
      # width = 100
      # height = 100
#      # normalized_width = 50
#      # normalized_height = 50
#      # relative_width = 100
#      # relative_height = 50

= What about image size?

You can use relative size.

  # image
  # src = usagi.png
  # caption = USAGI
  # keep_ratio = true
#  # normalized_width = 50
#  # normalized_height = 50
#  # relative_width = 100
  # relative_height = 50

= Image not in local?

  * external URL is OK

      # image
      # src = http://www.cozmixng.org/repos/images/cozmixchu.png
      # caption = COZMIX Chu

= Mathematical expressions?

  * TeX (like) format
  * backends
    * LaTeX
    * Tgif
    * mimeTeX

= LaTeX

  # LaTeX
  # relative_width = 80

  $f(x)=\displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt$

  \LaTeX

= Tgif

  # Tgif
  # relative_width = 80

  large f(x)=int {-infty} x~e^{-t^2}d t

= mimeTeX

  # mimeTeX
  # relative_width = 80

  \Large f(x)=\Bigint_{-\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt

= Or use EPS

  * set up EPS before presentation
    * but need gs

  # image
  # src = equation.eps
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_width = 80

= SVG is OK, too

  # image
  # src = spiral.svg
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 100

= Tgif is OK, too

  # image
  # src = rabbit-balloon.obj
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 100

= Dia is OK, too

  # image
  # src = rabbit.dia
  # relative_width = 90

= GIMP is OK, too

  # image
  # src = rabbit.xcf
  # relative_height = 100

= Wrap word

looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong

= Source code

What about?

  like
  this
  def It's
    OK?
  end

What about?

= May be added color

What about?

  # enscript ruby
  like
  this
  def It's
    OK?
  end

What about?
