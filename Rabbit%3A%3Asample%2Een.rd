= What's this?

A presentation tool

  * written by Ruby
  * used GTK+ 2
    * because I want to do
      * OK?

= Features

  * source is RD
  * align with RWiki
    * edit source on the RWiki
    * when presentation, source is directory from RWiki
  * isolate RD and look and feel

= Available(('sup:up')) things(('sub:down'))

  * do (('del:not')) ((*emphasis*))
  * sub(('sub:script')) and super(('sup:script'))
  * mathematical characters (('&Sigma;'))(('&sum;sub:i=0'))
  * display image
  * auto reload modified source
  * reload theme

= More available things

  * auto generation of index page
  * right click menu
  * screenshot on the off screen
  * PS/PDF output (but quality is ...)
  * Internationalized message
  * Table

= Not available

  * graffiti on the slide
  * inline image
  * organize screenshots
  * jump to the link

= ToDo

  * handle sound
  * handle 3D (I wish there were a library of X3D)

= Call on

  * cool themes
  * great documents

= Save slides

  * can save slides as image
    * organizing screenshots is work of other tools
    * ((<RAA:gallery>)), zphoto and so on

= What about image?

  * OK, if it is not inline

    resizable

      # image
      # src = lavie.png
      # caption = Lavie
      # keep_ratio = true
      # width = 100
      # height = 100
#      # normalized_width = 50
#      # normalized_height = 50
#      # relative_width = 100
#      # relative_height = 50

= What about image size?

You can use relative size.

  # image
  # src = usagi.png
  # caption = USAGI
  # keep_ratio = true
#  # normalized_width = 50
#  # normalized_height = 50
#  # relative_width = 100
  # relative_height = 50

= Image not in local?

  * external URL is OK

      # image
      # src = http://www.cozmixng.org/repos/images/cozmixchu.png
      # caption = COZMIX Chu

= Mathematical expressions?

call mimeTeX

  # TeX
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_width = 80
  
  \Large f(x)=\Bigint_{-\infty}^x~e^{-t^2}dt

= It's dirty

  * set up EPS before presentation
    * but need gs

  # image
  # src = equation.eps
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_width = 80

= SVG is OK, too

  # image
  # src = spiral.svg
  # keep_ratio = true
  # relative_height = 100

= Wrap word

looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong
